# 2D-Rubik

I visualised the 2D Rubik's cube and implemented my own method of solving it.

Solving the Rubik's "cube" (Rubik's square) takes a few seconds since it's limited to 1 turn/frame.

The algorithm uses commutators and the keyhole algorithm (which is also a method for solving the original cube), but its transfer to 2D is not trivial.
